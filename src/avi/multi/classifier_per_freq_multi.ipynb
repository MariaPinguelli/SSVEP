    "1. **Carrega** o arquivo `fif` (`mne.EpochsArray`) dos dados **filtrados**;\n",
    "2. **Determine o limiar** para isolar cada uma das frequências estimuladas. Por exemplo, a faixa de frequência para o estímulo de 6.5 Hz irá resultar em pontos (`PSD`) que irão variar de 6.3 à 6.7 Hz, caso o limiar seja de 0.2 Hz;\n",
    "3. **Obter a \"energia\"** do sinal por meio do cálculo `compute_psd` para cada uma das faixas de frequência que podem ser estimuladas. Por exemplo:\n",
    "    - Obtenha todas as frequências estimuladas. Ex: 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8.2 e 9.3;\n",
    "    - Obtenha o valor mínimo e o máximo para cada frequência utilizando limiar. Ex: (5.8, 6.2), (6.3, 6.7), ...\n",
    "    - Aplique o `compute_psd` para cada tupla (min, max), por meio dos parâmetros `fmin` e `fmax` do mesmo método.\n",
    "4. Com as listas de pontos isoladas e computadas (`PSD`) para cada amostra, aplique um cálculo de característica adequada. Características manuais interessantes para este exemplo podem ser `max_value`, `average` ou `median`. No fim deste passo iremos obter um **vetor de características**;\n",
    "5. Por fim, realize a **classificação**, que será um **cálculo de voto** simples (maior valor é provavelmente o a frequência evocada).\n",
